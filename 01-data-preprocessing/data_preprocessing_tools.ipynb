So, it **depends on your business problem, on the way your data is distributed and on the number of missing values**. If for example you have a lot of missing values, then mean substitution is not the best thing. Other strategies include \"median\" imputation, \"most frequent\" imputation or prediction imputation. Prediction Imputation is actually another great strategy that is recommended but we didn't learn yet. Once we learn this, using the k-NN algorithm is a good choice for this situation, but this could possibly be adding inaccuracy to our model."

Indeed, standadisation will only make it worse, because it will transform these values between -3 and 3, and making this we lose the interpretation of the variables. In this dataset, if we apply feature scaling in dummy variables, we will lose the information of which country corresponds to the observation. However, we have to apply the feature scaling to the age and salary columns, since we have a wide range of values. But even so, despite losing the interpretation of our data, in some cases, apply feature scaling to dummy variables can optimize the accuracy of our model."
